They have undergone a kidney transplant and require ongoing management of tacrolimus, Amlodipine, and Lisinopril for hypertension and blood pressure control. Additionally, they are treated for prediabetes with Humulin Injectable Suspension and insulin isophane human and regular human. Their medication regimen has evolved over time, with changes including the introduction of Simvastatin in August 2024 for hyperlipidemia management, discontinuation and subsequent restart of Lisinopril and Amlodipine, and prescription of Acetaminophen/Dextromethorphan/doxylamine oral solution for cough relief. Prior to 2024, they were also prescribed Naproxen sodium for osteoarthritis and had various types of insulin injections between July 2019 and August 3, 2022. The patient's medication dispensing dates vary across different medications, with some medications having multiple prescribing periods due to changes in their regimen over time.",

In August 2022 to September 2023, appointments focused on both medical and dental care with multiple follow-ups for hyperlipidemia, check-ups, and problem encounters due to tooth loss. Between August 2023 and January 2024, the patient was actively engaged in medical care with frequent visits to urgent care and emergency room admissions, including a one-hour procedure, and regular check-up appointments discussing hyperlipidemia management. In 2024, there were four additional appointments: two \"check up\" encounters on February 14 and May 29, a \"General examination of patient\" on August 14, and a \"Follow-up encounter\" due to hyperlipidemia on August 21, bringing the total number of recent appointments to highlight ongoing care for various conditions.",
